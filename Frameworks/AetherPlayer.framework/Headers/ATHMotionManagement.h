/**
 Expectations that must be fulfilled by an appliation-wide "wrapper" around
 CMMotionManager for ATHVideo's use.

 Per Apple's documentation, it is recommended that an application will have no
 more than one `CMMotionManager`, otherwise performance could degrade. The
 challenge for the host application using ATHVideo is that there may be
 entities outside of ATHVideo that also require device motion updates. It is
 undesirable that all these entities would have direct access to the same shared
 manager, leading to misconfigurations or a premature call to 
 `stopDeviceMotionUpdates`. To facilitate the use of a shared motion manager 
 without exposing a surface area for misuse, the `ATHMotionManagement` protocol
 defines a set of expectations for a shared "wrapper" around a shared 
 `CMMotionManager`. The conforming class must ensure that a shared
 `CMMotionManager` is kept private, properly configured, and activated or
 deactivated at the appropriate times.

 A host application is free to provide a custom class conforming to
 `ATHMotionManagement`. If your application does not use a CMMotionManager 
 outside of ATHVideos, we recommend that you use the shared instance of 
 `ATHMotionManager`, a ready-made class that already conforms to 
 `ATHMotionManagement`.
